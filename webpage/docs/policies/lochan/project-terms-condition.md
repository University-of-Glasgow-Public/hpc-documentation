# Lochan: Project Policy

If you are a PI of a Project you have to agree and abide by policy below.

---

1. The storage space provided for a Project should only home data that is used for HPC and not be used for long term or archival purposes.
2. The storage space allocated for a Project is not to be used as primary storage. The PI and their members are responsible to set up their own backups.
3. The PI of a Project is responsible to confirm or deny any requested access by users. On request the admin team can provide a list of all users with access.
4. If the space is no longer required, the PI is responsible for approaching the admin team about retiring the Project.
5. The admin team will approach the PI of a Project on a yearly basis, to verify the continued usage of the Project. Where this is not confirmed or proven, the Project might be retired.
6. Upon retirement of a Project, the PI and their members are responsible for copying all data still required from the storage space allocated, within one month. After an additional three months, all data is permanently deleted.
